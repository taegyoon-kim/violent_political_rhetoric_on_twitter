# Violent Political Rheotric on Twitter


## About

Recently, concerns are raised about the violent nature of political communication on social media: many social media platforms are exploited by users who write posts threatening violence against political opponents as part of normalized expression of radical partisanship. Violent political rhetoric - political language that threatens, incites, or supports violence against political opponents - on social media was implicated in extremists' effort to motivate and organize the Jan 6 Storming of the Capitol that left a vivid and deep scar on the U.S. democracy (including mainstream platforms such as Twitter). Violent political rhetoric is worrisome not only because it serves as a signal/hotbed for extremist offline violence but also because exposure to such rhetoric has negative political consequences such as increased tolerance for offline violence against political opponents and ideological polarization. Also, such rhetoric is in itself a behavioral manifestation of radical/lethal partisanship where individuals not just hate out-partisans but also support and even enjoy the use of offline violence against them.

How prevalent is violent political rhetoric on social media? How do posts containing such rhetoric respond to the offline world politics? How diffusive is it and what predicts its spread? What types of political figures are targeted with such violent rhetoric? Who are the users who threaten violence against political opponents? To answer these questions, I develop a method for automatic detection of violent political rhetoric, focusing on Twitter. I apply the method to collect a data set of Tweets containing violent political rhetoric, spanning the 14-week period surrounding the 2020 Presidential Election. The key (tentative) findings include:

* Violent political rhetoric is rare (0.07\% of political communication) but is spread through multiple chains on following ties (10% of retweets traveling over at least three ties), incidentally exposing a potentially huge size of audience and thereby amplifying its effects.
* It responds to offline political events in terms of its substance and prevalence.
* Users who write violent Tweets are on the fringe of the Twitter network and those users are ideologically more extreme and liberal than non-violent users.
* Spread of violent Tweets exhibits strong ideological homophily but there is also substantial amount of cross-ideological exposure.
